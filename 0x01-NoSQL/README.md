## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a basic understanding of NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB, and how they can be utilized in a back-end application. The project covers the following key aspects:

1. **NoSQL Concepts**: Explains the fundamental concepts of NoSQL databases and their advantages over traditional relational databases.
2. **MongoDB**: Introduces MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database management system, and its features.
3. **Back-end Development**: Demonstrates how to implement a NoSQL back-end using MongoDB, including data modeling, querying, and data manipulation operations.
4. **Integration**: Shows how to integrate the MongoDB back-end with a front-end application or API.
